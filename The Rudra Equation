Abstract:
We propose The Rudra equation :The sum of the squares of three distinct prime numbers
is never equal to the square of fourth distinct prime number .The conjecture has been tested
computationally on all combinations of prime numbers up to 10,000 and no counterexamples
were found.A formal proof is not given the results suggest that the equation is consistent
and may hold true.The problem remains an open problem
1.Introduction
Prime numbers inspired many mathematicians throughout history due to their deep role in
number theory.Today we are proposing a conjecture involving squares of distinct prime
numbers.This equation has been tested computationally but remains unproven.
2.Statement of Equation
Let a, b, c, d be four distinct prime numbers. Then:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \ne d^2
3.Computational Evidence:
A Python program was used to test all combinations of three distinct prime numbers where
a,b,c <10,000 for each triplet ,the sum of a^2+b^2+c^2 was computed and checked whether
it equals the square of fourth distinct prime number d^2.Despite checking it to millions of
combinations no counterexamples were found.

4.Conclusion:
Although the equation appears simple it remains unproven itâ€™s consistency across a
large number of tests suggest that it may hold in general
Inspired by mathematical elegance admired by Ramanujan the author offers this equation an
open problem inviting further attempts at proofs or counterexample from math community
The author respectfully dedicates this equation to Lord Shiva
